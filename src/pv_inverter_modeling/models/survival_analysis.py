class KaplanMeierModel(object):
    """
    Kaplan-Meier survival analysis model for detecting productivity
    degradation events in daily time-series data.

    This class converts daily aggregated productivity sequences into a
    binary failure process based on a relative threshold, computes
    time-to-failure durations, and fits a Kaplan-Meier survival model
    to estimate the probability of remaining above the productivity
    threshold over time.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : numpy.ndarray
            Array of shape (num_days, num_timesteps) containing daily
            productivity values (e.g., power measurements per day).
            Values are expected to be non-negative.
        water_mark : float, default 30.0
            Percentage of the median daily productivity used as the
            failure threshold. Days with total productivity below
            (water_mark / 100) x median are treated as failure events.

        Notes
        -----
        - Daily productivity is computed as the sum across timesteps.
        - A binary event sequence is created where 1 indicates failure
          and 0 indicates normal operation.
        - Durations and censoring indicators are derived automatically.
