class PredictiveMaintenance(object):
    """
    End-to-end predictive maintenance workflow for inverter power data.

    This class orchestrates the full lifecycle of a sequence-based
    forecasting and monitoring pipeline, including:

    - Loading and preprocessing inverter AC power time-series data
      via a dedicated Polars-based data pipeline
    - Formatting continuous intraday data into fixed-length input and
      output windows suitable for sequence-to-sequence models
    - Defining, training, loading, and running an LSTM-based forecasting
      model
    - Generating qualitative forecasts and visual diagnostics
    - Monitoring recent predicted power generation trends against
      configurable thresholds

    The workflow is designed for exploratory analysis, model-driven
    forecasting, and heuristic-based monitoring rather than strict
    probabilistic inference. Most methods operate on internally stored
    state initialized at construction time.

    Typical usage
    -------------
    >>> pm = PredictiveMaintenance(path, file, verbosity=1)
    >>> pm.train_model()
    >>> pm.testout(index=[0])
    >>> pm.Monitor_Power(numbers_of_days=30, threshold=0.6)
    
    Notes
    -----
    - Time is discretized at 5-minute resolution (288 steps per day).
    - Forecasts are multi-step, predicting full future horizons in a
      single forward pass.
    - Several methods produce visualizations intended for human
      inspection rather than automated decision-making.

        - Extracts padded daily AC power data for a single inverter

        Visualize recent predicted power generation and flag 
        low-performance trends.

        This method aggregates model-based power generation estimates 
        over the most recent test windows and visualizes them as 
        percentages of a reference maximum. A horizontal threshold line 
        is overlaid to mark a minimum acceptable performance level.

        The threshold can be interpreted either as:
        - an absolute power value ("absolute"), or
        - a percentage of the observed maximum ("percentage").
