    """
    Execute the end-to-end predictive maintenance workflow.

    This entry point orchestrates the full modeling pipeline for
    inverter-level power generation forecasting and monitoring. It:

    - Initializes the predictive maintenance system with configuration
      and logging settings
    - Loads and preprocesses historical inverter time-series data
    - Trains a sequence-to-sequence LSTM forecasting model
    - Generates and visualizes a sample multi-day forecast
    - Monitors recent predicted power generation against a configurable
      performance threshold

    The workflow is intended for exploratory analysis, model validation,
    and qualitative monitoring rather than automated deployment.

    Notes
    -----
    - The inverter identifier is provided via ``PDM_SAMPLE_DEVICE``.
    - Forecasts are generated at 5-minute resolution.
    - Monitoring thresholds may be interpreted as percentages or
      absolute values depending on configuration.
